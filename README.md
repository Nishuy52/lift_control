# Lift Control Package

A ROS2 package for controlling a two-level lift system using action servers and clients.

## Overview

This package implements a state-based lift control system with the following components:
- **Lift State Server**: Manages lift position and movement
- **Lift Commander**: Command-line interface for controlling the lift
- **Custom Action Interface**: Defines commands, feedback, and results

## Action Interface

### Command.action

**Goal (Commands):**
- `0` - STOP: Emergency stop (only allowed while moving)
- `1` - GO UP: Move to second level (from first level or between levels)
- `2` - GO DOWN: Move to first level (from second level or between levels)

**Result:**
- `completion`: 
  - `0` - Moving (partial completion)
  - `1` - Reached target level

**Feedback:**
- `status`:
  - `0` - Moving
  - `1` - Reached

## Lift States

The lift operates in five distinct states with specific command restrictions:

| State Code | Description | Allowed Commands |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| `001` | Stationary at First Level | GO UP only |
| `100` | Stationary at Second Level | GO DOWN only |
| `010` | Stationary Between Levels | GO UP or GO DOWN |
| `011` | Moving to First Level | STOP only |
| `110` | Moving to Second Level | STOP only |

## Building the Package
```bash
# Navigate to workspace
cd ~/lift_ws

# Build the package
colcon build --packages-select lift_control

# Source the workspace
source install/setup.bash
```

## Running the System

### Terminal 1: Start the Lift Server
```bash
ros2 run lift_control lift_state
```

The server will:
- Initialize at the first level
- Publish lift status every 2 seconds on `/lift_state` topic
- Listen for action commands on `/lift_action`

### Terminal 2: Start the Command Interface
```bash
ros2 run lift_control lift_command
```

The CLI will display:
```
=== LIFT CONTROL ===
0=STOP 1=UP 2=DOWN q=QUIT

> 
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Move from First to Second Level
1. Lift starts at First Level (001)
2. Enter `1` (GO UP)
3. Lift moves to Second Level (110 → 100)
4. Command succeeds

### Example 2: Invalid Command (Rejected)
1. Lift is at Second Level (100)
2. Enter `1` (GO UP) - **REJECTED**
3. Only GO DOWN is allowed from second level

## Topics

### Published
- `/lift_state` (std_msgs/msg/String)
  - Publishes current lift status every 2 seconds
  - Format: "XXX: Description"

### Subscribed
- `/lift_state` (std_msgs/msg/String) - by lift_command
  - Displays lift status in terminal

## Actions

### /lift_action (lift_control/action/Command)
- **Server**: lift_state node
- **Client**: lift_command node
- Validates commands based on current lift state
- Provides real-time feedback during movement
- Returns completion status

## State Machine Logic

The lift implements a state-based command validation system:
```
First Level (001) --[GO UP]--> Moving Up (110) --[COMPLETE]--> Second Level (100)
                                    |
                                 [STOP]
                                    |
                                    v
Second Level (100) --[GO DOWN]--> Moving Down (011) --[COMPLETE]--> First Level (001)
                                    |
                                 [STOP]
                                    |
                                    v
                        Between Levels (010) --[GO UP/GO DOWN]--> Moving...
```

## Features

### Command Validation
- Commands are validated based on current lift state
- Invalid commands are rejected before execution
- Clear feedback on rejection reasons

### Real-time Feedback
- Movement progress updates (0-100%)
- Status updates during operation
- Completion notifications

### Safety Features
- State-based command restrictions
- Emergency stop capability
- Thread-safe state management

### Concurrent Operation
- Publisher runs on timer (500ms intervals)
- Action execution in separate thread
- Non-blocking command interface

## Development Notes

### Future Enhancements
- Hall effect sensor integration for floor detection
- Speed control for movement
- Multi-floor support (beyond 2 levels)

### Simulated Behavior
Currently, the lift:
- Simulates movement over 10 steps (5 seconds at 2 Hz)
- Uses timers instead of actual sensor feedback
- Models realistic state transitions

## Dependencies

- ROS2 Humble
- rclcpp
- rclcpp_action
- rclcpp_components
- std_msgs
- action_msgs

## Troubleshooting

### "Action server not available"
- Ensure lift_state is running before lift_command
- Check that both nodes are in the same ROS2 domain

### "Goal was REJECTED"
- Check current lift state
- Verify command is valid for current state
- See state machine diagram for allowed transitions

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clean build
cd ~/lift_ws
rm -rf build install log
colcon build --packages-select lift_control
```
